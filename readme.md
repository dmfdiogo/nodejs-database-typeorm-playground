# About the challenge

In this challenge, i must keep developing a transaction management application, training what i've  learned so far in Node.js together with TypeScript, but this time including using a database with TypeORM and sending files with Multer!

This will be an application that should store incoming and outgoing financial transactions and allow the registration and listing of those transactions, in addition to allowing the creation of new records in the database by sending a csv file.
